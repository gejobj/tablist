This is a nova sidebar extension. It allows you to view the names of the files that you have in open tabs. You can set it as grouped or ungrouped file list.

This is a very early implementation and could contain bugs. The idea is to create a list (as functional as possible) of the open documents in tabs.

Please, feel free to modify or add features.

Thanks!
