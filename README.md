# tablist
Nova extension

This is a nova sidebar extension. It allows you to view the names of the files that you have in open tabs.

This is a very early implementation and could contain bugs. The idea is to create a list (as functional as possible) of the open documents in tabs.

Please, feel free to modify or add features.

Thanks!
